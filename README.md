# aeroOptDatabase
database for benchmark aerodynamic optimisation shapes

This is a database of geometries and/or meshes for various aerodynamic optimization cases, created and maintained by the Computational Design Laboratory (CODElab) at Iowa State University.

The purpose of this database is:
1. Store baseline and optimization results from different optimization groups
2. Share geometries and/or meshes from studies performed by various optimization groups
3. Compare results from different CFD solvers and meshing software
4. Compare results from different optimization methods

Please email us at leifur@iastate.edu or jethro@iastate.edu if you would like to include your results in our database.

Include the following:
1. Link to conference or journal paper (if published)
2. Geometry in .dat/.profile format for airfoils, .igs for others
3. Mesh in CGNS (.cgns), SU2 (.su2) or Plot3D (.xyz) format. (not compulsory)
4. CFD solver and setup used
5. Problem description along with important parameters used (if not included in the paper)
6. Any other useful information that would be helpful for others to perform the same study
